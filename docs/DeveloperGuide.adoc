== Introduction
Study Buddy is a task-management tool made for students who want to be able to track and manage their tasks in one place.

It uses various visualization tools such as pie charts and calendars, provides useful features such as the Due Soon task list, a productivity tracker etc to make task management simple and convenient.

In particular, Study Buddy is a Command Line Interface (<<CLI,CLI>>) application that also provides some Graphical User Interface (<<GUI,GUI>>). This means that users are expected to interact with their Study Buddy mainly through the command line, but each command executed will evoke a visual response as well.

The purpose of this guide is to help potential developers get up to speed on the Study Buddy code base and functionality. We hope that this document will ease the process of further enhancing and developing Study Buddy.

== Design

//tag::ArchitectureDiagram[]

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

//end::ArchitectureDiagram[]

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/draganddrop/studybuddy/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/draganddrop/studybuddy/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[NOTE]
HiddenModel is used to represent the hidden contents of the Model Component.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width = "450"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width = "650" ]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/draganddrop/studybuddy/ui[`Ui.java`]

The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` which is made up by different components such as `StatusBarFooter`, `FeedbackDisplayBox`,
 `CommandBox` as well as variants `Panels` and `Cards`. All these components, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/draganddrop/studybuddy/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]


The `UI` component::
* *Interacts with user* in an interactive process with the help of `Logic` component.
** `CommandBox` collects the user keyboard input.
** `Logic` parses user input in each interaction and executes the command subsequently if the interaction ends without any exception.
** `FeedbackDisplayBox` responses system information to user, such as error message and command execution result.
*** When invalid input received, proper message will respond via `FeedbackDisplayBox`. The interaction of the command will not be terminated, user can continue with the process with valid input.

* *Listens for changes to Model data* so that the UI can be updated simultaneously.
** All Cards components and `CalenderPanel`, `ModuleListPanel`, `ProductivityPanel` and `TaskSummaryPanel` will listen to
the changes to Model data.

[NOTE]
The command execution will only terminate in two scenarios: +
1.  When the command is successfully executed. +
2.  When the user enter `quit` and kbd:[enter] to exit the execution.

//tag::logicComponent[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width = "800" length = "500"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/draganddrop/studybuddy/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. After receiving the user input from Ui, `InteractivePrompt` processes the user's input.
.. If the user input is complicated, `InteractivePrompt` uses `Parser` classes to
parse the input.
.. If more information is needed from the user, `InteractivePrompt` signals the `Ui`
component to prompt the user for more information using the `interact` command.
Otherwise, if no more information is needed, proceed to the next step.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding or editing a task).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying a help message to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `interact("list")` API call.

image::ListTaskSequenceDiagram.png[width = "700", length = "600", title = "Sequence diagram for list"]

[CAUTION]
The lifeline for every member should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

//tag::modelComponent[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width = "500", length = "500"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/draganddrop/studybuddy/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Study Buddy data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
//end::modelComponent[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="600", height="400"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/draganddrop/studybuddy/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Study Buddy data in json format and read it back.
* saves all tasks, due soon tasks, archived task, modules and stats.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `draganddrop.studybuddy.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


=== Interactive Command Process Feature

==== Implementation

. *Feature introduction*
+
The Interactive Command Process Feature allows user to execute his/her command in an
interactive way.

. *Implementation detail*
+
This feature applies on all commands provided by Study Buddy and is implemented using:

.. The `*CommandBox*` from `UI` component to collect user input and init an associate interactivePrompt
.. The `*InteractivePrompt*` from `Logic` component to parse user input step by step and generate meaningful response
message accordingly.
It also produces an executable `Command` from each successful interaction to perform the user's desired action.
... Different types of `InteractivePrompt` such as `AddTaskInteractivePrompt` are provided to handel interactions with different purpose.
+
image::AddTaskObjectDiagram.png[width = "550" align="center" title = "Object diagram when user add task using interactive command process"]
+
... Allow user to quit from each step of an interaction using `quit` (case insensitive) key word. Here is an example of user quiting from add task interactive command process.
+
image::QuitFromInteractionActivityDiagram.png[width = "550" align="center" title = "Activity diagram when user quite from add task interactive command process"]

==== Example Usage Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the interactive command process mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time and skips the user guid.
By following the hint from `UI` (i.e. when `CommandBox` is idle, it should display "Please enter your command here..."),
he can try some random input and hit enter to get the list of available commands.

Step 2. The user picks a command from the list and type it in the `CommandBox`. The guide information of the next step will
display in `FeedbackDisplayBox` after user press enter.

[NOTE]
For some commands there is only one interaction involved, such as `help` and `list`. In such a case
the application will execute the command right after user press enter.

Step 3. The user made a typo mistake in the data and time filed when adding a task record.
Proper massage with the error type and the correct format of the data and time will be displayed in the
`FeedbackDisplayBox`. User can follow the instruction to continue the interaction.

Step 4. The user is performing an interaction to edit a task, but realized he/she
chose a wrong task from the list, he/she can use `quit` to exit
the process without making any changes to the task.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to react to an invalid input
* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* provides relevant error message and stays at current interaction step.
+
** *If the next input is*
+
- Invalid: provides the relevant error message and continue waiting for another input.
- Valid: start next interaction step.
- `quit`: quite from the command process.

** Pros: Save the data from previous stages, especially in add task interaction, thus user no need to repeatedly
enter the same information. Also the clear instruction provided by error message makes the
interaction more straightforward.

** Cons: The interaction can only be stopped when user successfully complete the process or use
`quit` to exit half-way.

* **Alternative 2:** Quite from current step with proper error message.
** Pros: Quit the interaction immediately, which allows user to start with a new
interaction. It will be useful when user want to quit from a particular process but forgets the exit command
(i.e. `quit`).
** Cons: User has to restart the entire interaction process when the he/she enter
invalid command.

// tag::dueSoon[]
=== Due Soon Tasks Feature

==== Implementation

The Due Soon Tasks feature allows users to view the tasks that have deadlines within the next week.

This feature is implemented using a panel on the main window with a list of tasks Due Soon that is updated with every command that may affect Due Soon task list (such as add, delete or archive).

Some situations that trigger due soon feature are:

. *When user enters a task:*

.. What it does: +
... When a task that is added to the main list, is due within the next week, it is automatically added to the list of due soon tasks. +
... The list is automatically sorted to be in increasing order of deadlines. +
... The time left for the deadline is also added.
+
image::AddDueSoonActivityDiagram.png[width = "200", length = "300", title = "Activity Diagram for Add to Due Soon list"]
{bl}

.. Details: +
... The add command when entered by the user, triggers the creation of an object of the InteractivePrompt class (in this case AddTaskInteractivePrompt). +
... In the AddTaskInteractivePrompt class, the data entered by user is parsed. +
... If there are no errors, the AddTaskCommand object is created which triggers the addTask() function in Model. +
... This function in turns calls addTask() function in Study Buddy. +
... This function calls the isDueSoon() function in Task to confirm if the task belong to the due soon list. +
... If it does, it is added to due soon list and main list, and the due soon list is sorted. Else, it is simply added to the main list.
+
image::AddDueSoonSequence.png[width = "800", length = "600", title = "Sequence Diagram for Add to Due Soon list"]
{bl}
[CAUTION]
The lifeline for every member should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
{bl}

. *When user deletes a task:*

.. What it does:
... When a task that is deleted from the main list occurs in the due soon list as well, it is automatically deleted.
+
image::DeleteDueSoonActivityDiagram.png[width = "200", length = "300", title = "Activity Diagram for Delete from Due Soon list"]
{bl}
.. Details:
... The delete command when entered by the user, triggers the creation of an object of the InteractivePrompt class (in this case DeleteTaskInteractivePrompt).
... In the DeleteTaskInteractivePrompt class, the data entered by user is parsed.
... If there are no errors, the DeleteTaskCommand object is created which triggers the deleteTask() function in Model.
... This function in turns calls removeTask() function in Study Buddy.
... removeTask() calls the updateDeleteDueSoon() function in StudyBuddy which checks if the task exists in the due soon list.
... If it does, it is deleted from the due soon list and main list. Else, it is simply deleted from the main list.
+
image::DeleteDueSoonSequence.png[width = "800", length = "600", title = "Sequence Diagram for Delete from Due Soon list"]
{bl}
[CAUTION]
The lifeline for every member should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[NOTE]
Other commands like edit, archive etc also trigger due soon feature in a similar manner.

. *When user refreshes due soon list:*

.. What it does: +
... Refreshes the list of due soon tasks and status tags. This command is useful for a situation where due soon list is not up to date due to a drastic change in time.
+
image::DueSoonActivityDiagram.png[width = "500", length = "600", title= "Activity diagram for refresh"]
{bl}
.. Details:
... The refresh command when entered by the user, triggers the creation of an object of the InteractivePrompt class (in this case RefreshTaskInteractivePrompt).
... In the RefreshTaskInteractivePrompt class, the data entered by user is parsed.
... If there are no errors, the RefreshCommand object is created which clears the due soon list and then, iterates through the main list and calls addDueSoonTask() in Model, for any tasks that are due soon.
+
image::DueSoonSequenceDiagram.png[width = "800", length = "600", title = "Sequence diagram for refresh"]
{bl}
[CAUTION]
The lifeline for every member should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

. *When the application launches:*

.. What it does:
... It loads the due soon tasks into a panel by filtering tasks that are due soon from the main list.
... This is necessary, because old list of due soon tasks may not be up-to-date.

.. Details:
... The addTask() function in StudyBuddy class already checks if task is due soon and adds to due soon list (as mentioned above).
... While all tasks are being added to their respective lists in JsonSerializableStudyBuddy class, the due soon list gets automatically updated.

[NOTE]
Calculation of time left for deadline and check for if task is due soon can be found in the Task class.
//end::dueSoon[]

==== Example Usage Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Due Soon list mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

The list of tasks Due Soon will be initialized and displayed with the initial study buddy state. Initialization is done by filtering tasks that are Due Soon from the general list of tasks.

Step 2. The user executes `add` command to add a task.
The `add` command execution checks if this task belongs in the Due Soon tasks list (i.e it is due in 7 days). If it does, the task is added to both lists, else it is only added to the main list. +

Step 3. The user executes `delete` command to delete a task.
The `delete` command execution also checks if this task exists in the Due Soon task list. If it does, task is deleted from both lists, else it is only deleted from the main list.

Step 4. The user executes `refresh` command to refresh the due soon task list.
The `refresh` command execution will traverse the main list and check if there are any inconsistencies. For example, if there has been a change in time and a task is missing from the due soon task list, it will be added.
It will also update the time left.

[NOTE]
If there are no such inconsistencies, the refresh command will not make any changes to the Due Soon task list.

//tag::refresh[]
==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `refresh` command works

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Clear and reload the due soon task list.
** Pros: Less prone to errors since the entire list is "refreshed".
** Cons: More operation intensive.
* **Alternative 2:** Does not clear and reload the due soon task list.
** Pros: Fewer operations need to be performed.
** Cons: May have be more prone to errors because list is not completely "refreshed". Some parts of it are the same.
// end::refresh[]

//tag::taskSummary[]
=== Task Summary Feature

==== Implementation

. *Feature introduction*
+
The task summary feature automatically summarizes the collected data into different charts.
It also allows the user to click on a chart to find the relevant tasks.
The UI of the feature is in the `Statistics` Page.
. *Implementation detail*
+
This feature is implemented using `JavaFx` charts such as `PieChart`, `AreaChart` and `StackedBarChart`, as well as a
`Task List Panel`.
+
The `Task List Panel` is used to show the relevant task records when the user clicks on `charts`.


. *Table of Charts & DataBind & OnClick Action*
+

[TIP]
To improve the readability, only the tasks due or start within the next *60 days* will be counted into `Area Chart`.
+
[cols="3,2,3",options="header"]
|===
|Chart Type |Data Used|OnClick Action

|*PieChart* +
{bl}
Compare the number of tasks in different statuses.

|Display tasks under the selected module and type.

|===
+
image::TaskSummaryOnClickActivityDiagram.png[width = "650" align="center" title = "Sequence diagram for task summary UI update when data change"]

. *OnChangeListener*
+
The feature listens to the change of `Model's` `UnArchived Task Records`, `Archived Task Records` and `Module Records`.
+
Once a change is captured, the charts will automatically re-render to show the latest statistics.
+
Currently, commands as `add` `edit` `delete` `sort` `find` `archive` `done` `list` `clear` etc. can
trigger the refresh of the charts.
+
image::TaskSummaryOnDataChangeSequenceDiagram.png[width = "800" align="center" title = "Sequence diagram for task summary UI update when data change"]
+
[NOTE]
It is possible that the labels of charts can overlap together.
This is an unfixed bug regarding the JDK which is caused by JavaFX chart off-sync. To get more information, you may refer to link:{jdk_bug_report}[here].
When this issue happens, you can use any command that can trigger chart updating to refresh.

==== Example Usage Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the task summary mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time, the statistics will perform on top of the sample records,
and the result will be visualized into different charts organized in the `Tab Panel`. After the user clicks `Statistics`
from the top menu bar, the `Tab Panel` and the `Task List Panel` will display.

Step 2. The user navigates to the `Statistics` Page for the first time. The `Tab Panel` should
display the `Pie Chart` and the `Task List Panel` is empty with a title: "Click on Chart to View Related Tasks".
Indeed, this is how the `Statistics` Page looks like every time the user navigates back from another Page.

Step 3. The user clicks on `Pie Chart` 's `Pending` portion. All tasks in `Pending` status should display in `Task List Panel`.
Meanwhile, the title of the Panel will change to "PENDING: # Tasks" (# stands for the number of `Pending` tasks).

Step 4. The user clicks on `Area Chart` 's `CS2101` area. All tasks under `CS2101` should display in `Task List Panel`.
Meanwhile, the title of the Panel will change to "Tasks under CS2101".

Step 5. The user executes `add` command at `Statistics` Page,
the charts should update automatically.

Step 6. The user executes `done` command at another page, and navigate back to `Statistics` Page
the charts should show the latest statistics.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Will this feature contribute value to CLI user
Consideration::
Task Summary feature involves mouse clicking event when user retrieving relevant tasks.
+
Explanation::
The Task Summary Feature provides tow main services:
 1. The *automatic statistics* of the user input (i.e. the tasks and modules information).
 2. The relevant *records retrieving*.

+
The retrieving service is built on top of the statistics result.
Meanwhile, the statistics is auto-generated along the way the user managing their records using *keyboard input*. +
Therefore, this feature can make a fast typist be more productive, especially when Study Buddy
supports the CLI.

===== Aspect: How to update charts
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `onChangeListener` to monitor the data update and re-render the UI simultaneously.
** Pros: More user-friendly, no need to ask user to manually update.
** Cons: Might encounter JavaFX chart off-sync bug, and results in label overlapping. But user can always use another
command which can trigger data updating to walk around this problem.
* **Alternative 2:** Trigger the UI rendering by asking the user to re-launch the application or navigate away and back to the page.
** Pros: Safe from the JavaFX chart off-sync bug.
** Cons: Force user to close or navigate around the application every time he/she wants to
check the updated charts.
// end::taskSummary[]

//tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar feature

==== Implementation
The calendar feature displays a calendar for users.

The feature is implemented by overriding the task list display panel on the main window with calendar box. The calendar currently supports following features:

. Displays the name of all tasks on that day in the calendar grid.
. Access calendars in previous or next month using the buttons on top.
. Displays more information about tasks for the day on the Due Soon panel after clicking on a grid.
. Fast forward to a specific year/month using CLI.

When a calender is requested, a CalendarPanel object is constructed, the object diagram below shows the structure of a CalendarPanel. We will be using the date `01/04/2020` as an example.

image::CalendarBoxObjectDiagram.png[title="CalendarPanel object diagram"]

Tasks shown in `calendar` will automatically be updated upon using any of the following commands:

* `add`
* `delete`
* `archive`
* `unarchive`
* Any other commands that modifies the task list

==== Example usage scenarios

===== Using mouse click
Clicking on the show calendar menu item under the calendar menu will enable this feature. Upon requesting for the calendar to be shown:

. The calendar box object will be constructed
. The calendar loops through every day of the month while searching for tasks due on that day
. The task name is added to the calendar grid

===== Using CLI
As of Study Buddy v1.4, a new feature has been added that allows users to navigate the calendar using CLI.

. The user enters 'calendar' into the command box.
. The user enters the selected date into the command box.
. Calendar will be generated the same way as a mouse click, however, it will use the entered date as parameters.

It is implemented by getting the latest instance of `MainWindow` and directly changing the UI by calling `handleShowCalendar()`.

Below is an activity diagram describing the events that will happen:

image::CalendarActivityDiagram.png[width = "400", length = "600" title = "Calendar Activity Diagram"]

==== Design considerations
* It is more efficient to cache the calendar rather than to generate a new one, however, we do not expect the user to have too many tasks and therefore it should not slow down the application.
* The implementation used for CLI involves a static method in MainWindow which might be unsafe, however, it was the best choice given the time constraints.
//end::calendar[]

//updated by gexiang
//tag::archive[]
=== Archive feature
Archive stores selected task away into a separate task list, this command is used when the user has completed a task but still wants to keep track of it.

==== Implementation
Archive uses a new archive command. Upon executing the archive command, it will call the model to delete the task and archive it
into another list stored within model.

[NOTE]
The index for archived tasks are not used for any commands other than `unarchive`.

Sequence diagram:

image::ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png[width = "600", length = "500" title = "Archive Sequence Diagram"]
[CAUTION]
The lifeline for every member should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

==== Design consideration
There were two possible ways to store archived tasks:

. Store it as a separate list
. Add another field to task to keep track of its archived state

The first choice was chosen as it speeds up the runtime. Also, it makes it easier to manage the indexes.
//end::archive[]

//tag:productivity[]
=== Productivity feature

==== Implementation
The productivity feature displays insights related to the user's productivity over the
past day, week and more on the Productivity panel.
The Productivity page is integrated with the main page as a side panel.

The Productivity page is further composed of 3 tabs:

. Daily Productivity Tab

. Weekly Productivity Tab

. Productivity Points Tab

The Productivity page can be viewed by clicking on the Productivity menu item,
which directs the user to the Daily Productivity Tab.
The Productivity page can also be viewed by clicking on the Productivity Points shown on
the top right of the application window.
This directs the user to the Productivity Points Tab.

The productivity feature is facilitated by the `Statistics` class, which allows
StudyBuddy to keep track of relevant usage statistics of the user.
`Statistics` is further composed of classes that keep track of specific statistics:

.. `CompletionStats` keeps track of the number of tasks completed by the user each day and each week

.. `OverdueStats` keeps track of the number of tasks that went overdue each day and each week.

.. `ScoreStats` keeps track of the user's Productivity Points and rank each day

.. `GeneralStats` keeps track of the user's goal, streak, and other statistics not covered by the other statistics classes

The object diagram for the Productivity feature is shown below: +

image::ProductivityObjectDiagram.png[width = 900 title="Productivity object diagram"]

The Productivity feature displays the Producitivity Points of the user, this is recorded in `currentScore`
and `scoreList` attributes in `ScoreStats` class.

The user can gain or lose Productivity Points in StudyBuddy when certain actions or events are completed.
These include:

.. Adding a task: _+1_

.. Completing a task: _+10_

.. Completing your daily goal: _+(points equivalent to daily goal)_

.. Using advanced features; _+1_

.. Letting a task go Overdue: _-1_

Each usage statistic is updated accordingly when the respective user action or event
has concluded. These statistics are then rendered on the `ProductivityPanel`.
The chart visualizations are implemented using `ProgressIndicator`, `BarChart` and `AreaChart`.

When the statistics are updated, the task list's event listener and classes implementing
`GoalObserver` will be informed of the changes. `ProductivityPanel` re-renders the
displayed information when either of these are updated.

The data displayed will be automatically updated upon calling any of the following commands:

* `add`

* `done`

* `delete`

* `refresh`

* `goal`

* Any command that modifies the task list

==== Example Use Scenario
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the
Productivity feature behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application.
Step 2: The Productivity feature displays the user's Productivity Points on the top right of the screen.
Step 3: The user clicks the Productivity Menu button
Step 4: The Daily Productivity Tab is displayed to the user
Step 5: The user completes a task using `done`
Step 6: The daily number of tasks is added and Productivity Points is increased.
If the daily goal has been reached, the user's streak is incremented.

Here is an activity diagram of the aforementioned steps:

image::ProductivityActivityDiagram.png[width = "400", length = "500" title = "Productivity Feature Example Activity Diagram"]

Extension: Suppose the user sees the Productivity Points and clicks it
Step 3: The user clicks the Productivity Points on the top right of the screen
Step 4: The Productivity Points Tab is displayed to the user

From here, the user can continue to manage tasks as per Step 5 and 6 above,
or navigate to other Productivity tabs.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to re-render Productivity Panel when statistics are updated
*Alternative 1*: re-render only the values that have been updated

- Pros: maximizes loading speed and minimizes lag for the user

- Cons: increases complexity for codebase, higher chance of bugs occuring

*Alternative 2*: always re-render the whole Productivity Panel

- Pros: easy to implement

- Cons: may result in slower loading speed and more lag for the user

*Alternative 3 (current choice)*: re-render only the values that have been updated
if it does not result in increased code complexity

- Pros: improves loading speed and decreases lag for the user,
while keeping the codebase readable and easy to reason with.

- Cons: may result in slower loading speed. However, based on testing,
this trade-off does not result in any measurable delay.

//As far as feasible, the productivity feature re-renders only the values that
//have been updated. This improves the loading speed and minimizes lag for the user.
//However, in some cases, this will lead to more complicated code to reason with.
//As such, the productivity feature sometimes re-renders more values than necessary.
//Based on testing, this trade-off made by the productivity feature does not result
//in any measurable delay.

=== Modules
(Contributed by Hong Wen)
The `modules` feature enables users to be able to group and view their tasks according to various modules or subjects.
Each module is assigned with a unique module code & a name.
By default, all task created with the `add` command will be be assigned to module code `OO0000O`.

==== Implementation
Modules are created with `create mods` Command and the program will request for a module name and module code. There are no restrictions on module name as long as it is not an empty entry.

Module codes however, require at least an alphabetical prefix, a number, and a postfix(optional).

```
Correct moduleCodes:
A0A
CS11X
AA1234

Incorrect moduleCodes:
123456
CAT
555T
```

==== Sequence diagram for creating modules
This is a sequence of how a module is created using the `create mods` feature. Take note that all interactions go through the `CommandBox` first in the UI, but it will be omitted from this diagram for simplicity.

image::ModuleSequenceDiagram.png[width = "1000", length = "800", title= "Sequence diagram for modules"]
1. When the user keys in  `create mods` or click *Module/create* on the menu bar,
a `CreateModuleInteractivePrompt` class is created. It automatically constructs an `EmptyModule`.

2. The interactivePrompt class will then change module attributes such as
name and `ModuleCode` on according to user input.

3. At the last stage, the prompt will construct a `CreateModCommand` for execution.
It will go through the various layers in Model before returning to the prompt,
which will then return to the user.

[CAUTION]
The lifeline for every member should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== [Proposed] Data encryption

Since Study Buddy is an offline application, there is no threat of being attacked via a network channel. However, in case the computer has a shared owner, a password feature can be implemented in the future for privacy purposes.

==== Implementation
The goal is to encrypt `taskList3.json`, while still allowing the owner to access his/her tasks using his password.

We will be using AES (Advanced Encryption Scheme) for encryption, and a slow hashing algorithm to derive a key from the user's password. The slow hashing algorithm is to prevent brute force attacks.

=======
*Encryption*

. User sets a password. (Optional)
. Study Buddy uses a slow hashing algorithm (https://github.com/patrickfav/bcrypt[bCrypt]) to generate a key.
. When user exits the app, Study Buddy will encrypt taskList.json using the https://github.com/facebookarchive/conceal[conceal] library and the generated key.
. TaskList.json should now be encrypted
=======
=======
*Decryption*

. User enters a password.
. If the password is correct, the same key should be hashed and taskList.json can be decrypted.
. If the password is incorrect, user will be allowed to try again.
=======

We leave it to the user's own jurisdiction to create a strong password.

== Effort

*Interactive prompt*

* <<AB3,AB3>> requires users to input a whole line of text at once, which is unintuitive and prone to typos by the user.

* Furthermore, <<AB3,AB3>> uses tags like "`\p`" to break the user's input up for parsing. This means that users will not be able to use these strings for any of their inputs.

* Study buddy fixes that issue by introducing an interactive prompt for every command. This required a lot effort as there had to be an interactive prompt
for every command.

*Refactoring*

* While <<AB3,AB3>> uses the `Person` class which had 5 fields, Study buddy uses the `Task` class that has 12 fields and every one of them is used in a major feature.

* The <<GUI, GUI>> has seen a major revamp, with 5 different tabs as well as some sub-tabs.
