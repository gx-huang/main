== PROJECT: Study Buddy

== Overview

StudyBuddy is a desktop application designed for students who *wish to manage their module related tasks* in a convenient and user-friendly interface.
It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) but still contains the benefits of *Graphical User Interface* (GUI).
The codebase is in Java and contains about 13kLoc.

== Summary of contributions

=== Enhancements

*Major enhancements*

* Added a *calendar* to Study buddy.
** _What it does_:
*** The calendar allows users to have an overview of all the tasks that has to be done.
*** Calendar also allows you to view all tasks due on the day the user clicks on.
** _Justification_:
*** This feature is important as the task list will be too cluttered without it.
*** A calendar gives a good indication of how busy the user is going to be.
** _Highlights_
+
Challenges faced when implementing this feature:

. Had to learn what the different panes and objects in javafx does and choose the most suitable one for the feature
. There was an 50% chance (tested) the click event would return the wrong object,
leading to complications. This meant that tasks cannot be within the calendar itself.
I had to reverse engineer the algorithm used to generate a calendar and use that data to find tasks for the date the user clicked on.

* *Archive* and *unarchive*
** _What it does_:
*** Allows users to store their task into a separate archive list
*** Unarchive retrieves tasks from archive list and stores it into the main list
** _Justification_:
*** Archive allows users to store task that they have completed or do not wish to look at right now, while still keeping those tasks in check.
*** This is important as users sometimes do not wish to delete a task they completed.
** _Highlights_:
*** This feature was not particularly difficult to implement. However, as it is the first feature to be pushed to address book,
I had to carefully trace and modify the code to make sure it did not break address book.

*Minor enhancements*

* *Calendar view command*
** Calendar view command was created in response to an https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W16-3/main/issues/217[issue] that claimed the app is not CLI friendly.
** This command allows a user to jump to any date they want to on the calendar.
** It also serves as a way to find tasks by date.
