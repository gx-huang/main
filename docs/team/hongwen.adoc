== PROJECT: Study Buddy

== Overview

StudyBuddy is a desktop application designed for students who *wish to manage their module related tasks* in a convenient and user-friendly interface.
It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) but still contains some aspects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) which was written using JavaFX.
The codebase is in Java and contains about 13kLoc.

== Summary of contributions

=== Main Enhancements

==== Designed the Module Feature
** Function:
This optional feature enables users to view their tasks sorted according to the modules that they have taken.
Each module is designed to contain a name, a unique module code, as well as all the tasks that it holds.
Users can choose to assign their task to any module they want (or not at all), as well as create new modules,
edit or delete any existing modules.

** Justification:
Given how college students have many, many task coming from multiple assignments,
I believe this is one of the good way they can organise and view their tasks if they need to sift
multiple tasks.

** Highlights:
One of the challenging features is to design something for tasks that do not have any modules
assigned to them. All task by default will have a module attached to them, so we have to create a "figurehead" module
for these tasks. This figurehead module have to be able to conceal its module code from the user and has to prevent
users from edits and deletes.

Another difficulty is dealing with storage. To avoid changing the order of the tasks, module has to be designed to
temporarily store tasks instead of actually storing it in the program.


==== Edit & Create Module Function
** Function:
These 2 features allows users to create new modules, as well as edit existing modules. Users cannot
create any modules with duplicate names or code, or those with invalid module codes. In `edit mods`,
users can choose to edit name, code or even delete existing modules.

** Highlights:
One key challenge with designing `edit mod` function is dealing with existing tasks is under the module.
The program has to be designed to change the module of each consecutive task that was under the module,
making this portion fragile.

==== Added Complete Function
** Function:
Allows users to set their task from pending to `Finished`.
** Justification:
To allow users to mark their task as complete so that it can be easily ignored /hidden by the user.


=== Minor Enhancements
==== Added 'modules' option in Edit function
** Function:
Allow users to edit change the module in which the task was assigned to.

** Justification:
So that users can edit and reassign task to a different existing module.


=== Team-based Tasks
.. Debugged a serious bug involving storage that was holding the entire team back for a week at the start of tP.
.. Help to refactor team's code by creating parent class.
.. Helped repackaged some of the old codes into separate folders, as well as reorganizing
`commands` and `interactiveprompts` into many folders
.. Modified & cropped many of the team's UG images for better readability.
.. Helped shorten some existing nested codes with `streams`.

=== Review/Mentoring
