[teal]#*Description:*# +
This Class Diagram explains the interactions between the
classes within the Logic Component.
It also explains how the Logic Component interacts with the Model component.

This diagram provides a high-level abstraction of the `Logic` component of the architecture. The detailed implementation is handled by other
diagrams in the Developer Guide.

Developers can use this high-level
overview to understand the `Logic` Component,
before diving into the detailed implementation of the `Logic` Component.

*Description:* +
This Sequence Diagram explains how the `list` command works. This is used as an example to illustrate how the `Logic` Component works.

This diagram shows the interaction between Ui, Logic and Model during the command `list`. Developers can use this as a reference for any new commands.

=== Productivity Feature Object Diagram

*Description:* +

This Object Diagram displays the objects used to record statistics needed for Productivity Feature.
It also shows how the different objects are related and interact with one another. +

This diagram is useful for developers who wish to modify how the Productivity feature works.
Objects used to display the Ui (e.g. labels and panes) are excluded from this diagram.


=== Productivity Feature Activity Diagram

image::ProductivityActivityDiagram.png[width = "300", title="Activity diagram for Productivity Feature"]

[teal]#*Description:*# +
This Activity Diagram illustrates an example use scenario for the Productivity Feature.
This diagram helps developers to understand the motivation behind the
Productivity Feature.

This diagram also helps to explain how the daily goal and streak mechanism works in StudyBuddy.
It shows that the user's streak is updated when the daily goal is reached.

With this understanding, developers can easily modify
the current behavior of the Productivity Feature.
