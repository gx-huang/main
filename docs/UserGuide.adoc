== Introduction
(Contributed by Souwmyaa) +

Study Buddy is a desktop application which is designed for students who *wish to manage their module related tasks*.
More importantly, Study Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This means that while you primarily interact with Study Buddy through text based commands, each command executed will evoke a visual response as well.

You will never have to remember long, wordy commands to use your command line interface, since Study Buddy *provides an interactive way of communication*.
This not only helps prevent typos, but also makes the application much easier to use!

If you can type fast, Study Buddy can get your module management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

The purpose of this document is to explain in detail, how users can utilize the various commands and functions that Study Buddy provides.

Currently, we support both Windows and Mac operating systems.
If you are interested, please jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

Hope you enjoy!

This command enables you to add a new task into Study Buddy.

- Through the interaction, task's details will be collected.
.. Required information: task name, task type, task deadline or duration
.. Optional information: module, task description, task weight, estimated number of hours needed
.. Input format requirement:
+
[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===

|===
+
.. Other constraints::
... The application does not allow you to enter a name that has special characters (any character that is not a letter in the alphabet).
... The application does not allow you to assign date time that has already passed to a task.
It must be a time in the future.
... For duration, the two dates should follow the order of `start date`-`end date`, the `end date` should be later than `start date`.
... The total weight of tasks under the same module is capped at 100.0.
* Both `archived` and `not archived tasks` will be taken into consideration.
* This constraint also applies to tasks without module information.
Those tasks will be treated as from a same extra module.
It is designed for you to practice your time management skill :).
... All `index numbers` entered should be positive and within a valid range. (i.e When there is only 5 modules available, the valid module index number range is 1 to 5).
... The "Required Information" cannot be empty, on the other hand, you can press kbd:[enter] to skip the "Optional Information".
.. Adding duplicate tasks:
... Look at <<Add duplicates>> for more information.

To `add`:

. Initiate the command using keyword `add` + kbd:[enter].
. Study Buddy should start with asking module information with `a list of available modules` as:
+
image::basic/add/add_module.png[width="790",align="center",title="Reponse to 'add', asks for module"]
+
. You can link this task with a module by entering its `MODULE CODE` | `INDEX NUMBER OF MODULE` here , or you can press kbd:[enter] to skip.
Here we use "1" (CS2101) as an example.
. After the selection of module, Study Buddy should ask for the task name.
Here we use "new task" as an example.
. After entered the task's name and press kbd:[enter], Study Buddy should prompt for task type with the list of available types as:
+
image::basic/add/add_task_type.png[width="790",align="center",title="Asks for task's type"]
+
. You can use the `INDEX NUMBER` here to choose a task type.
Here we use "1" (Assignment) as an example.
. After the selection of task type, Study Buddy will prompt for new task's date-time information together with the type related date-time format (i.e. different task types support different date-time formats).
Here we use "14:00 04/05/2020" as an example.

. Next, Study Buddy should ask for the new task's description, and we use "new task description" as an example.
. Then, Study Buddy should ask for the new task's weight.
Here we use "10" as an example.
. Next, Study Buddy will prompt for the estimated number of hours needed for this new task.
Here we use "10" as an example.
. Once you specify the estimated time needed and press kbd:[enter], Study Buddy should respond with the task details collected and ask for your confirmation to add the task as:
+
image::basic/add/add_task_info_1.png[width="790",align="center",title="Asks for user conformation to add a new task"]
+
image::basic/add/add_task_info_2.png[width="790",align="center",title="Task details collected"]
+
. Now, by pressing kbd:[enter] the new task will be added into your Study Buddy.
Meanwhile, the *All Tasks Panel* will update accordingly.
For this example, the panel should update as below.
+
image::basic/add/add_result.png[width="790",align="center",title="New task added"]

[TIP]
Remember, you can use `quit` command to quit at any step.

//tag::addDuplicates[]
==== Add duplicates
(Contributed by Souwmyaa) +

This command accounts for you adding duplicate tasks.
When you attempt to add a duplicate, the name will be modified slightly so that you can differentiate them.

*Example:*

Say you have tried to add a task, you enter all the fields needed and at the end, you realise that you have already added this task.

Study Buddy lets you add duplicate tasks with a slight modification!
So, now you can add the task and edit it as needed.

[NOTE]
A task is considered duplicate when the name, type, module, description, weightage, estimated time cost and deadline are the same.

[IMPORTANT]
This feature is case sensitive i.e if you have one task named "Homework" and another named "homework", they will be considered to be different.

To `add duplicates`:

. Follow the same steps as in <<Add>>, but enter a duplicate task.
. Study Buddy should respond with:
+
image::duplicate/addDuplicate.png[width="790",align="center",title="Reponse to adding a duplicate"]
+
. Type in `yes` if you would like to continue and `no` if you do not.
. If you type `yes` and press kbd:[enter]
. The Study Buddy should respond with:
+
image::duplicate/addDuplicate1.png[width="790",align="center",title="Response to adding duplicate"]
+
. As you can see in the snippet above, Study Buddy will append a number in brackets to the task name.
This number corresponds to the number of times this task name has been duplicated.
+
[NOTE]
If you add two duplicates of a task (eg: task(1) and task(2)), and then delete task(1), when u try to duplicate it again, it will get added as task(3).
The number will not reset to 2, because this is the third time you are attempting to duplicate.

. If you choose to enter `no` at step 2, this is what you will see.
+
image::duplicate/addDuplicate2.png[width="790",align="center",title="Response to choosing not to add"]

[TIP]
You can view all tasks that have been auto-edited this way, using the <<View renamed>>

[TIP]
Use the <<Edit>> to edit your duplicated tasks!
//end::addDuplicates[]

//Start updated by Yuting
==== Edit

This command is for you to edit an existing task.
To indicate the task you want to edit, you need to provide its index number.

*Example:*

Say when there are some typo in an existing task.
You can use this command to edit as you wish.

====
*Constraints*

. Each new value entered will be checked under the same constrain of add command.
More info you can refer from <<Add>>.
. When editing weight or module, the application will also make sure the total weight of related module's tasks will not overflow (i.e. exceed 100).
. You cannot edit a task to be a duplicate. i.e all the fields cannot be the same as a task that already exists.
. Due to the `deadline/Duration format` is different from `Assignment` to `Other Task Types`, we currently don't support:
.. `Assignment` -> `Another Tsk Type` editing
.. `Another Tsk Type` -> `Assignment` editing
====

To `edit`:

. Initiate the command using keyword `edit` + kbd:[enter].
. Study Buddy should start the task editing interaction by asking you the index number of the desired task.
Here use "1" (Homework 1) as an example.
. When you specified the target task, Study Buddy should continue the interaction by prompting you with the list of editable information.
You can choose any of them via an index number.
Here we use "2" (Task name) as an example.
+
image::basic/edit/edit_response_index.png[width="790",align="center",title="List of editable fields"]
+
. After you selected the field to edit, Study Buddy should asks you for the new value.
For this example, let's use "Updated Task" as the new task name.
. Once you specified the updated information and press kbd:[enter], the updated record will be captured, and the *All Tasks Panel* will update automatically.
For this example, the panel should update as below.
+
image::basic/edit/edit_result.png[width="790",align="center",title="Task edited"]
//End updated by Yuting

==== Done

(Contributed by Hong Wen)

//tag::Done[]

This command is for you to mark a task as *Finished*.

====
*Constraints*

. A *Finished* task cannot be marked as *Finished* again.
====

To `done`:

. Key in `done` and press kbd:[enter], you should get this prompt:
+
image::basic/done/done_index.png[width="790",align="center",title = "Asks for task index."]
+
. Now key in the index of the task you wish to complete.
+
. Press kbd:[enter] again to confirm your change.
+
image::basic/done/done_confirm.png[width="790",align="center",title = "Asks for confirmation"]

. Task set to `Finished` successfully!
Note that the task in your task list has the tag `Finished`.
+
image::basic/done/done_result.png[width="790",align="center",title = "Done result"]

//tag::delete[]
==== Delete
(Contributed by Souwmyaa) +

This commands deletes a task from the existing list, using the index provided by you. Index simply refers to the number on the left of the task in the `All Tasks` panel.

[CAUTION]
Once a task is deleted, it cannot be retrieved.
Use this command with caution!

*Example:*

After having added a task, you realise that there has been a change and you do not need to do that task anymore.

Study Buddy provides you an option to delete that task from the list!

To `delete`:

. Initiate the command using keyword `delete`
. Study Buddy should respond with:
+
image::basic/delete/delete_index.png[width="790",align="center",title="Response to 'delete'"]

==== View renamed
(Contributed by Souwmyaa) +

This commands filters all renamed tasks in the list i.e tasks that have a number appended to their names.

*Example:*

Say you want to go back and edit all the renamed tasks in your list.
However, you do not want to scroll through the entire list to find them.

Study Buddy provides you an option to view all your renamed tasks in the list!

[IMPORTANT]
You will still need to navigate to the main list and use that index to perform any index based operations (eg: delete, edit etc)

To `view renamed`:

. Initiate the command using keyword `view renamed`
. Study Buddy should respond with:
+
image::basic/viewrenamed/viewRenamed1.png[width="790",align="center",title="Response to 'view renamed'"]

//end::viewRenamed[]

//updated by gx-huang
//tag::archive/unarchive[]
==== Archive/ Unarchive

(Contributed by gexiang) +

This commands stores the specified task into a separate list.

*Example:*

After a hard days work, you completed some tasks.
You don't want them in your to-do list anymore, but you don't want to delete them; some of the information in the task card could still be useful.

You can always store them in an archive!

To `archive`:

. Initiate the command using keyword `archive`
. Study Buddy should respond with:
+

==== Refresh
(Contributed by Souwmyaa) +

This commands refreshes the list of tasks Due Soon as well as status tags.

[IMPORTANT]
Due soon list shows tasks due within the next week.
Details are in <<Due Soon Tasks>>

[NOTE]
Status tags include information on the tasks' status, eg: pending, overdue etc.

*Example:*

Say you left Study Buddy open for a few days.
When you come back, you notice that the time left for the deadline on the Due Soon tasks is not accurate.

You can refresh them!

[TIP]
Anytime you notice an inconsistency in time left/status, use this command!

To `refresh`:

. Say this is what Study Buddy looks like and you notice that the task "Homework 1" is still in pending status although it should be in due soon status.
+
image::basic/refresh/refresh_before.png[width="790",align="center",title="Current state (needs to be refreshed)"]

. Initiate the refresh command using keyword `refresh` and press kbd:[enter] to confirm the action.
. Tasks have been refreshed! You will notice that the pending task has now moved to the due soon list and the status has been updated.
+
image::basic/refresh/refresh_result.png[width="790",align="center",title="Refreshed Study Buddy"]
//end::refresh[]

[NOTE]
After 'refresh', the tasks in *All Tasks Panel* will be sorted by their deadline or start date.

=== Due Soon Tasks
(Contributed by Souwmyaa) +

The Due Soon task list is always on display in your application under `Study Buddy` -> `All tasks`

It provides the following functionality:

. It displays your tasks that are due within the next week. (uses deadline you have provided)
+
image::duesoon/due_soon.png[width="790",align="center",title="Due Soon List"]

. It automatically sorts these tasks in an ascending order of deadlines.
+
image::duesoon/due_soon_sort.png[width="790",align="center",title="Due Soon List Auto-Sort"]

. It automatically adds applicable tasks when you make changes to your main list, such as add (<<Add>>) or delete (<<Delete>>).

. It displays a tag with the time left to the deadline.
+
image::duesoon/due_soon_tag.png[width="790", align="center",title="Due Soon List Time Tags"]

. It provides a <<Refresh>> function that allows you to refresh time/state of this list if needed.

[NOTE]
Time left is never displayed in days and minutes.
Hence if the current time is 9:00 am on 01/04/2020 and the task deadline is 9:02 am on 02/04/2020, it will show time left as 1 day. (not 1 day and 2 minutes)

[NOTE]
Due soon list will never display finished tasks. eg: if you unarchive a completed task, it will not appear in the Due Soon list.
//end::dueSoon[]

=== Statistics

With all the tasks and modules' information you entered, Study Buddy can provide you with a real-time visualized statistics about:

- Task status
- Module related tasks' deadline/ start date
- Module related tasks' weight

It utilizes different types of charts to make the information more intuitive.
In addition, the chart is always updated in sync with your task records.
Especially when you execute commands such as
`add` `edit` `delete` `sort`  `find` `archive` `done` `list` and `clear`.

[TIP]
The colour theme will also change randomly, hope you enjoy :)

[NOTE]
The statistics feature is built on top of the data collected from the basic functionality described in <<Basic features>>.
